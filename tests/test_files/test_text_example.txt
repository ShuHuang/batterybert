While highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) has proven an effective way to control viral loads within the periph
eral blood compartment, it is less able to control replication in reservoirs such as the brain. The Drexel Medicine CNS
AIDS Research and Eradication Study (CARES) cohort has tracked more than 500 patients longitudinally with a subset of pa
tients that have been followed for more the 10 well-controlled visits spanning more than 7 years. The LTR and Tat exon 1
 region of these patients were examined using the Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees (BEAST) program to exami
ne underlying phylogenetic progression of their viral population. Patients were found to have a basal level genetic drif
t despite undetectable viral loads. As a result of this analysis the detected drift ranged from 0.2 to 2 bases per 100 n
ucleotides per year and was unique for each patient. Phylogenetic analysis of these patients revealed that sequence vari
ation between sequential visits may be due in part to differential activation of latent proviral DNA quasispecies and/or
 low level viral replication in various reservoirs that may occur even in well-controlled patient populations over prolo
nged time and ultimately detected in the peripheral blood compartment. Further analysis with viral deep sequencing acros
s longitudinal samples across the entire viral genome is expected to reveal a more exacting view of the rate and overall
 nature of genetic drift even in well-controlled HIV-1-infected patients.

Methamphetamine (Meth) is a potent and commonly abused psychostimulant. Exposure to Meth induces decreased neuronal acti
vity in the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens which are implicated in addiction; but it is unknown if such
a decrease results from alterations in synaptic/intrinsic excitability of neurons or changes in extracellular environmen
t (e.g., glutamate and K+ levels) mediated by surrounding astrocytes. To fill this knowledge gap, we assessed the effect
s of Meth on functional activity of certain voltage-gated ion channels in the cell membrane of primary human fetal astro
cytes (HFA) using whole-cell voltage-clamp recording. We found that HFA displayed a large out-flowing voltage-gated K+ c
urrent (VGKC, a characteristic of immature or reactive astrocytes), while voltage-gated Ca2+ currents were not seen. Fur
ther, exposure of HFA to Meth (300 μM, 3–6 h) induced a significant depolarization of the resting membrane potential (RM
P) and reduction of VGKC in the range of +70 to 100 mV in comparison to untreated HFAs (both p < 0.05). Our findings dem
onstrate that Meth disturbs HFA activity by altering RMP and VGKC. Because a Meth-induced decrease of K+ out-flow from a
strocytes can consequentially reduce local extracellular K+ levels, such a reduction could ultimately lead to a decrease
d excitability in neurons surrounded by these astrocytes.
