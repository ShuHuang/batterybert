Among rechargeable batteries, the lithium–sulfur (Li–S) battery is well known for high energy density (theoretical capac
ity of 1672 mA h g−1) and relative light weight.112 Compared with conventional lithium-ion batteries, lithium–sulfur bat
teries are lower cost due to the use of sulfur.113–115 The Li–S battery has recently attracted attention due to its high
 theoretical specific energy of 2600 Wh kg−1, which is about five times higher than that of common LIB.116,117 The react
ion process between electrode and electrolyte contains the dissolution of Li+ moving between the cathode surface and ano
de during discharging and charging as shown in Fig. 18. As is well known, the single host ion only combines 0.5–0.7 lith
ium ions in LIB, while each sulfur atom unites with two lithium ions. Nevertheless, compared to LIB, Li–S has volume exp
ansion–shrinkage as well, which could cause mechanical tension on the electrode and lead to reduced electrochemical conn
ection and hindered flow of Li+. Moreover, charge carriers can only diffuse on material surfaces because of poor electri
cal insulating of sulfur (5 × 10−30 S cm−1 at 25 °C).118 In addition, the dissolved polysulfides deposits on the anode,
reduces to Li2S and Li2S2, which always lead to low coulombic efficiency, poor cycling stability and irretrievable capac
ity fading.119 At present researchers are trying to address these challenges (e.g., electrochemical conductivity and the
 dissolution of Li2Sx (2 ≤ x ≤ 8)) through various solutions.120 As a metal oxide, zinc oxide and its composite make a s
ignificant contribution to Li–S batteries.121–123 Therefore, recent typical applications of zinc oxide-based nanomateria
ls in the Li–S battery are reviewed in the following paragraphs (Fig. 15).124,125
Finding a solution to improve the poor electronic conductivity is a big challenge for Li–S battery. In order to address
this issue, sulfur is usually dispersed in a conductive matrix such as conductive polymers and carbon nanomaterials. Lia
ng et al.126 used a classic two-step method consisting of hydrothermal procedure and heating treatment to make ZnO porou
s nanostructures. The synthesized S/ZnO composite material was heat treated at the temperature of 155 °C. They found tha
t the size of composite material was lighter than pure ZnO material because the former only absorbed sulfur on the surfa
ce. Moreover, compared to pure S, the S/ZnO composite showed good cycling stability and high discharge capacity of 1414
mA h g−1. After 100 cycles, 662 mA h g−1 capacity was maintained at current density of 335 mA g−1, which is much better
than pure S (470 mA h g−1 for the initial cycle and 169 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles). Surprisingly, the obtained columbic
efficiency was up to 97%. The combination with zinc oxide increases conductivity as the insulating property of sulfur an
d its reduced products (Li2S/Li2S2). in addition, the dissolution of polysulfides (Li2Sn, 4 ≤ n ≤ 8) can be reduced effe
ctively (Table 3).
